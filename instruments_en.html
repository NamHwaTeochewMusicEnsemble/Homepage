      <h2>Erxian 二弦</h2>
      <p>
        The erxian is a highly representative bowed string instrument of the Teochew region. 
        Originating from the xiqin of the Tang dynasty, it evolved through the jiqin of the Song and the lantou xian of the Ming, 
        and by the early Qing period had taken its modern form with an ebony soundbox covered in python skin. 
        Exquisitely crafted and often decorated with mother-of-pearl inlay, the erxian produces a bright, 
        penetrating tone that is both crisp and expressive, capable of conveying sweet and graceful melodies with strong 
        artistic appeal. In Teochew string poetry ensembles and opera, it frequently serves as the leading instrument, 
        guiding rhythm and emotional expression. With the spread of Teochew culture, 
        the erxian has reached Hong Kong, Macau, Southeast Asia, and even Europe and America, becoming an enduring 
        symbol of Teochew music.

        The large cymbals deliver powerful, majestic tones, often used to highlight dramatic moments or reinforce strong rhythmic 
        accents. The small cymbals, with their bright and agile timbre, are ideal for embellishing delicate passages or

      <h2>The Hanging Cymbal 吊钹</h2>
      <p>
        The hanging cymbal (diao-bo， also know as K cymbal) is a percussion instrument commonly used in Teochew music, 
        derived from the broader family of cymbals. 
        Typically played in a suspended position, 
        it produces a crisp and lingering tone that serves as an embellishment within the ensemble. 
        Unlike the large cymbals’ powerful resonance or the small cymbals’ bright agility, 
        the hanging cymbal is distinguished by its sustained sound, often marking transitions or enhancing atmosphere. 
        In grand gong-and-drum performances and ensemble settings, 
        it plays a supportive role, adding depth and spatial texture to the overall sound, 
        making it an essential rhythmic element in Teochew music.

      <h2>Kim Gia 钦仔</h2>
      <p>
        The Kim Gia (or qin-zai) is a distinctive small percussion instrument in Teochew music, 
        often featured in grand gong-and-drum ensembles and festive folk occasions. Resembling a small gong, 
        it produces a crisp and brief tone, typically used to signal rhythmic transitions or highlight structural changes 
        in the music. Though modest in volume, its sound is highly recognizable and serves as a guiding accent within the ensemble. 
        Frequently paired with larger gongs and cymbals, the qin-zai adds clarity and rhythmic definition, 
        making it an indispensable “cueing” instrument in Teochew musical tradition.

      <h2>Yue-luo, Jiu-zai-luo 月锣、九仔锣</h2>
      <p>
        The yue-luo (moon gong) and jiu-zai-luo (small gong) are traditional gongs frequently used in Teochew music, 
        each with distinct tonal qualities. The moon gong, being larger, produces a deep and sustained resonance, 
        often employed to create solemn atmospheres or mark transitions. 
        The small gong, by contrast, has a crisp and brief tone, 
        typically used to signal rhythmic changes or embellish ensemble passages. 
        Together, they complement each other in grand gong-and-drum performances and Teochew ensembles, 
        enhancing both the grandeur and rhythmic texture of the music. 
        These instruments serve not only as vital rhythmic anchors but also as expressive symbols of Teochew's unique musical 
        character.
